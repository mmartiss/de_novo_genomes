[Sat Oct 11 15:49:24 EEST 2025] STEP 1: Estimating genome size...
Estimated genome size: 4342670

[Sat Oct 11 15:50:12 EEST 2025] STEP 2: Subsampling reads...

Starting autocycler subsample (2025-10-11 15:50:12)
    This command subsamples a long-read set into subsets that are maximally
independent from each other.

Settings:
  --reads filtered_SRR34323118.fastq
  --out_dir subsampled_reads
  --genome_size 4342670
  --count 4
  --min_read_depth 25
  --seed 0

Input FASTQ:
  Read count: 23527
  Read bases: 150189101
  Read N50 length: 7477 bp


Calculating subset size (2025-10-11 15:50:12)
    Autocycler will now calculate the number of reads to put in each subset.

Total read depth: 34.6Ã—
Mean read length: 6384 bp

Calculating subset sizes:
  subset_depth = 25 * log_2(4 * total_depth / 25) / 2
               = 30.9x
  reads per subset: 20988


Subsetting reads (2025-10-11 15:50:12)
    The reads are now shuffled and grouped into subset files.

subset 1:
  reads 1-20988
  subsampled_reads/sample_01.fastq

subset 2:
  reads 5883-23527 and 1-3343
  subsampled_reads/sample_02.fastq

subset 3:
  reads 11765-23527 and 1-9225
  subsampled_reads/sample_03.fastq

subset 4:
  reads 17646-23527 and 1-15106
  subsampled_reads/sample_04.fastq


Finished! (2025-10-11 15:50:15)
    You can now assemble each of the subsampled read sets to produce a set of
assemblies for input into Autocycler compress.

[Sat Oct 11 15:59:39 EEST 2025] STEP 4: Compressing assemblies...

Starting autocycler compress (2025-10-11 15:59:39)
    This command finds all assemblies in the given input directory and
compresses them into a compacted De Bruijn graph. This graph can then be used
to recover the assemblies (with autocycler decompress) or generate a consensus
assembly (with autocycler resolve).

Settings:
  --assemblies_dir assemblies
  --autocycler_dir autocycler_out
  --kmer 51
  --threads 8


Loading input assemblies (2025-10-11 15:59:39)
    Input assemblies are now loaded and each contig is given a unique ID.

   1: flye_01.fasta contig_1 (4350361 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
   2: flye_02.fasta contig_1 (4350080 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
   3: flye_03.fasta contig_1 (4350359 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
   4: flye_04.fasta contig_1 (4350364 bp) [consensus weight = 2]

4 sequences loaded from 4 assemblies


Building k-mer De Bruijn graph (2025-10-11 15:59:39)
    K-mers in the input sequences are now hashed to make a De Bruijn graph.

Graph contains 8603922 k-mers


Building compacted unitig graph (2025-10-11 15:59:48)
    All non-branching paths are now collapsed to form a compacted De Bruijn
graph, a.k.a. a unitig graph.

742 unitigs, 1005 links
total length: 4301961 bp


Simplifying unitig graph (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    The graph structure is now simplified by moving sequence into repeat unitigs
when possible.

742 unitigs, 1005 links
total length: 4291908 bp


Finished! (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    You can now run autocycler cluster to group contigs based on their
similarity.

Time to run: 0:00:32.849882


[Sat Oct 11 16:00:12 EEST 2025] STEP 5: Clustering contigs...

Starting autocycler cluster (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    This command takes a unitig graph (made by autocycler compress) and clusters
the sequences based on their similarity. Ideally, each cluster will then contain
sequences which can be combined into a consensus.

Settings:
  --autocycler_dir autocycler_out
  --cutoff 0.2
  --min_assemblies 2 (automatically set)
  --max_contigs 25


Pairwise distances (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Every pairwise distance between contigs is calculated based on the
similarity of their paths through the graph.

4 sequences, 16 total pairwise distances

Saving distance matrix:
  autocycler_out/clustering/pairwise_distances.phylip


Clustering sequences (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Contigs are organise into a tree using UPGMA. Then clusters are defined from
the tree using the distance cutoff.

Saving clustering tree:
  autocycler_out/clustering/clustering.newick

Cluster 001:
  flye_01.fasta contig_1 (4350361 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
  flye_02.fasta contig_1 (4350080 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
  flye_03.fasta contig_1 (4350359 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
  flye_04.fasta contig_1 (4350364 bp) [consensus weight = 2]
  cluster distance: 0.00007
  passed QC


Finished! (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    You can now run autocycler trim on each cluster. If you want to manually
inspect the clustering, you can view the following files.

Pairwise distances:         autocycler_out/clustering/pairwise_distances.phylip

[Sat Oct 11 16:00:12 EEST 2025] STEP 6-7: Trimming and resolving clusters...
[Sat Oct 11 16:00:12 EEST 2025] Processing cluster_001...

Starting autocycler trim (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    This command takes a single-cluster unitig graph (made by autocycler
cluster) and trims any overlaps. It looks for both start-end overlaps (can occur
with circular sequences) and hairpin overlaps (can occur with linear sequences).

Settings:
  --cluster_dir autocycler_out/clustering/qc_pass/cluster_001
  --min_identity 0.75
  --max_unitigs 5000
  --mad 5
  --threads 8


Loading graph (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    The unitig graph is now loaded into memory.

742 unitigs, 1005 links
total length: 4291908 bp


Trim start-end overlaps (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Paths for circular replicons may contain start-end overlaps. These overlaps
are searched for and trimmed if found.

flye_01.fasta contig_1 (4350361 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed
flye_02.fasta contig_1 (4350080 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed
flye_03.fasta contig_1 (4350359 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed
flye_04.fasta contig_1 (4350364 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed


Trim hairpin overlaps (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Paths for linear replicons may contain hairpin overlaps at the start and/or
end of the contig. These overlaps are searched for and trimmed if found.

flye_01.fasta contig_1 (4350361 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed
flye_02.fasta contig_1 (4350080 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed
flye_03.fasta contig_1 (4350359 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed
flye_04.fasta contig_1 (4350364 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: not trimmed


Exclude outliers (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Sequences which vary too much in their length are now excluded from the
cluster.

Median sequence length:    4350360 bp
Median absolute deviation: 2 bp
Allowed length range:      4350350-4350370 bp

flye_01.fasta contig_1 (4350361 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: kept
flye_02.fasta contig_1 (4350080 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: excluded
flye_03.fasta contig_1 (4350359 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: kept
flye_04.fasta contig_1 (4350364 bp) [consensus weight = 2]: kept


Clean graph (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    The unitig graph is now cleaned up based on any trimming and/or exclusion
that has occurred above.

725 unitigs, 983 links
total length: 4291899 bp


Finished! (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    You can now run autocycler resolve on this cluster. If you want to manually
inspect the trimming, you can run autocycler dotplot on the sequences both
before and after trimming.

Starting autocycler resolve (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    This command resolves repeats in the unitig graph.

Settings:
  --cluster_dir autocycler_out/clustering/qc_pass/cluster_001


Loading graph (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    The unitig graph is now loaded into memory.

725 unitigs, 983 links
total length: 4291899 bp


Finding anchor unitigs (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Anchor unitigs are those that occur once and only once in each sequence.
They will definitely be present in the final sequence and will serve as the
connection points for bridges.

391 anchor unitigs found


Building bridges (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    Bridges connect one anchor unitig to the next.

     Unique bridges: 391
Conflicting bridges: 0


Applying unique bridges (2025-10-11 16:00:12)
    All unique bridges (those that do not conflict with other bridges) are now
applied to the graph, with linear paths merged to create consentigs.

1 unitig, 1 link
total length: 4350362 bp

All bridges were unique, no culling necessary.
